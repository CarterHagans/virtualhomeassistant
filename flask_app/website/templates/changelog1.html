        <ul id="changelogList">
          <li id="changelogListItem">&#8680; On the initial release of the application, one ting that was added was the web editor. The web editor allows you to
            have an easy way of visualizing the things that are on your shopping list. You are able to remove, edit, and add items to the list
            directly through the web editor. Also available on the web editor is the ability to edit family details such as the family name,
            family admins and family members. 
          </li>
          <li id="changelogListItem">&#8680; Another thing introduced with the initial release of the application was the ability to use text commands. You are able 
            to text commands such as adding, removing, or editing items directly through your text messaging app without having to go on the 
            web editor, the AI will take care of everything for you.
          </li>
          <li id="changelogListItem">&#8680; A final thing that was introduced with the initial release of the application is the communication features between
            the web editor and the AI. Since they share the same database, you can view information of your family and list in real time.
          </li>
